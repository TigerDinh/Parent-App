Clean & Simple Code
     - Neat onCreate
     - Proper use of space and indentation

Use Meaningful Names for functions and variables

Naming Conventions
    - Constants must be all upper case, with multiple words separated by '_':
    - Class names must start with an upper case letter, and use CamelCase.
        Classes should be named in terms of a singular noun:
    - Do not use prefixes for variables: don't encode the type (like iSomeNumber, or strName),
        do not prefix member variables of a class have with m_.
    - Boolean variables should be named so that they make sense in an if statement
    - Use named constants instead of literal numbers (magic numbers). It is often acceptable
        to use 0 and 1; however, it must be clear what they mean:

Indentation and Braces {...}
    - Use when possible

Statements and Spacing
    - Declare each variable in its own definition, rather than together (int i, j).

Classes
    - Inside a class, the fields must be at the top of the class, followed by the methods.

Comments
    - Comments which are on one line should use the // style. Comments which are or a couple lines
         may use either the //, or /* ... */ style. Comments which
         are many lines long should use /* ... */.

Comments vs Functions
    - Your code should not need many comments. Generally, before writing a comment,
        consider how you can refactor your code to remove the need to "freshen" it up with a comment.
